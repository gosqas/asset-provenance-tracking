        <p>
            The Global Open Source Quality Assurance System (GOSQAS) provides the opportunity to create truthful, transparent documentation via our open source provenance tracker, Global Distributed Tracking (GDT). Designed specifically for low-resource settings, GDT allows anyone with simple website access to securely record their project data. Our development philosophy of “Trust Through Transparency” (TTT) encourages better global communication within diverse communities- to include humanitarian response, open source hardware, and scientific research.
