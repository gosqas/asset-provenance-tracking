# Global Open Source Quality Assurance System Microclimate Tracking
-- Anusha Shringi

Microclimate monitoring involves the measurements as well as analysis of climate conditions in
small, localized areas. They are influenced by various factors such as topography, vegetation,
and human activity. High school students and even college students can engage in hands-on
learning experiences by integrating the Global Open Source Quality Assurance System
(GOSQAS) into their microclimate studies.This will help enhance scientific exploration but also
foster various skills in technology, biology, and environmental studies.
GOSQAS will facilitate microclimate studies through this processes:
1. QR code Integration: GOSQAS will use the QR codes as the element used for tracking and updating
microclimate data. These monitoring stations will be in the designated observation study
area. They will have assigned unique QR codes for that specific station.
2. Data Collection: Students will install/attach the QR codes to the ground or wooden pole at the station to
monitor the microclimate conditions. When observing, students will be allowed to update
the GOSQAS database within that QR code for additional information of what is currently
happening at that specific time.
3. Usable Provenance System: GOSQAS’s QR code allows anyone with access to the QR code to contribute and
access information about the microclimate. This includes temperature, wind speed, and
other relevant data information.
4. Real-time updates: Participants—ranging from students to teachers to community members—can provide
real-time updates on the environment conditions by scanning the QR code and inputting
data through the simple web interface.
5. User-Friendly Interface: GOSQAS offers an user-friendly interface for updating and accessing microclimate data.
This ensures that students with varying levels of technical expertise can actively
contribute to the study.
6. Educational Insights: The GOSQAS platform for that specific station can hold educational resources related to
microclimate studies through participants pasting the links into the database. These links
can include articles, tutorials, or interactive content that helps students understand
scientific principles behind their observations.

Through these microclimate studies and the tracking of them through GOSQAS’s system, there
are a myriad of benefits for high schoolers. These include interdisciplinary learning in which
students can have an understanding of microclimate studies and the role of technology in
environmental monitoring. Two, community engagement. GOSQAS encourages community
participation by allowing residents to contribute to microclimate studies, as well as local
stakeholders. This will foster a sense of environmental management and community
involvement. Third, a real-world application. Students will experience a hands-on application of
technology in scientific research. GOSQAS transforms microclimate studies from theoretical
concepts into real-world data collection projects. Fourth, collaborative research. Similar to
community engagement, students will be ensured collaborative research efforts through
engagement with those at the same school or even across different locations who come by the
stations. And lastly, data analysis skills. Students will be able to analyze data using GOSQAS’s
interface, which will allow for essential skills to be learnt or utilized for data interpretation,
graphing, and drawing scientific conclusions
