# Global Open Source Quality Assurance System Location Status Tracking
-- originated by Anusha Shringi

One way to use GOSQAS is to associate a key with a specific location. 
This makes it easy for anyone in the location to make an observation about the state there.
There are many different things you could be interested at this point. For example:
1. Does the location need cleanup or repair?
1. What birds are visible from the location?
2. What is the current weather or microclimate there?
3. Are the plants in flower? In leaf? In need of water?

The basic features of GOSQAS should make this easy by allowing a durable QR code, perhaps
with some instructions, to be posted in the location. 
Then a user who reads the instruction may be willing to use their phone to enter a short,
useful observation. These observations over time may create an imporant record of what is 
happening there.
