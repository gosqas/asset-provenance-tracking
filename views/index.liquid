    <h1>GOSQAS Asset Provenance Tracker</h1>
    <div class="col-8 my-3">
        The Global Open Source Quality Assurance System (GOSQAS) was formed to promote trust in open source medical devices and supplies.
        GOSQAS believes that increasing transparency around the quality and safety of these devices is necessary for global acceptance. 
        To achieve this, GOSQAS has developed a â€œTrust Through Transparency'' (TTT) approach to ensure the safety and efficacy of medical devices made from open source designs. 
        The GOSQAS Asset Provenance Tracker allows anyone with access to an open source medical device to trace the provenance and add to it using a simple website. 
        For more information, please see our <a href="https://github.com/gosqasorg/home">Github repository</a>.
